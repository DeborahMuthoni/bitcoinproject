                <p class="text">? What happens if I lose my Bitcoins?<br>Unfortunately, since unique private keys are associated with indivisual Bitcoin wallets, if the keys are lost,there is ultimately no way to retrieve that key without a passcode seed or other retrieved system; and that key is required to spend those coins. However, most moders wallets, like Mycellium, have wallet and key backups that you can build prior to storing money.This will allow you to create a new private key so that you may restore your private key on a new wallet if lost.</p>

However, smetimes it can take Bitcoin miners 30 or even 60 minutes to mine a single block(1 confirmation). This is outside of Kranken's control </p>
